# Enhancing Forensic Audio Investigations: A Multi-Speaker Speech Understanding and Analysis System

This repository contains a **multi-speaker speech understanding and analysis system** designed to enhance **forensic audio investigations**. The system leverages state-of-the-art models for **speech separation**, **enhancement**, **emotion classification**, **gender recognition**, and **speaker identification**. It uses the **VoxCeleb dataset** for speaker recognition and the **SepFormer model** for speech separation and enhancement. We employ **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for emotion classification and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for gender prediction. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated on a custom dataset generated by mixing VoxCeleb audio files, highlighting its potential for forensic applications. Our results indicate that the system performs robustly in multi-speaker environments, offering reliable predictions for each task.

## **Project Overview**

The system is designed to process **multi-speaker audio** by performing the following tasks:

- **Speech Separation**: Using the **SepFormer** model to isolate individual speakers from mixed audio.
- **Speech Enhancement**: Enhancing the quality of the separated audio using the **SepFormer enhancement model**.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Classifying emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **neutral**, **fear**, **disgust**, and **surprise** from the speech audio.
- **Gender Classification**: Predicting whether the speaker is **male** or **female** using an **LSTM-based model**.
- **Speaker Identification**: Using the **VoxCeleb dataset** for identifying and matching speakers.

## **Dataset**

### **1. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Datasets**
The following datasets were used for training the **emotion recognition model**:

- **Ravdess**: A dataset that includes audio and video of actors performing emotions.
- **Crema**: A speech emotion dataset featuring emotional expressions from actors.
- **Savee**: A dataset with speech recordings categorized into various emotions.
- **Tess**: A dataset containing emotional speech recordings used for emotion recognition.

### **2. Gender Classification Dataset**
This dataset contains **5,768 female** and **10,400 male** voice recordings in **.wav** format, each ranging from **1.5 to 5 seconds** in length. The data was obtained online and is used for **gender classification** based on audio.

## **Model Architecture**

The emotion recognition model uses a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify emotions from speech, while the gender classification model is based on an **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) network for sequential data analysis. The speaker identification task uses the **ECAPA-TDNN** model trained on the **VoxCeleb dataset**.
